# Specification: Improve Documentation

## Overview
Revamp the project documentation to be more user-facing, detailed, and engaging. The goal is to move beyond dry technical reference and create a welcoming "Dojo" where users are excited to learn. The tone should strike a balance between clear, precise technical instruction and the project's "fun" martial arts aesthetic.

## Functional Requirements
1.  **Getting Started Guide:**
    -   Rewrite the installation and setup guide to be friendlier.
    -   Include a "First Kata" (Hello World) section that gets the user debugging immediately.
2.  **Concept Explanations:**
    -   dedicate a section to explaining the "Dojo" philosophy and the "Belt" system (Gamification).
    -   Clarify *why* this tool exists compared to standard `pdb`.
3.  **Tutorials/How-Tos:**
    -   Create a "White Belt" tutorial: Basic debugging flow (breakpoints, stepping).
    -   Create a "Green Belt" tutorial: Advanced inspection (`i()`) and comparison (`c()`).

## Non-Functional Requirements
-   **Tone:** "Detailed but fun". Use thematic flavor text (e.g., "Entering the Dojo", "Sharpening your Kit") for headings and introductions.
-   **Clarity:** Technical steps must remain direct and unambiguous. Do not let the metaphor obscure the instruction.
-   **Structure:** Ensure the navigation sidebar in MkDocs is logically organized to reflect this new structure.
