# Implementation Plan: Specialized Comparers

## Phase 1: Design and Logic
- [ ] Task: Research existing diff libraries (e.g., `deepdiff`) vs custom implementation.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Design and Logic' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Dictionary Comparison
- [ ] Task: Write Tests for dictionary diff scenarios (nested, type changes).
- [ ] Task: Implement dict comparison logic with rich output.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Dictionary Comparison' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: List Comparison
- [ ] Task: Write Tests for list diff scenarios.
- [ ] Task: Implement list comparison logic.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: List Comparison' (Protocol in workflow.md)
