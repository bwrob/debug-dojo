# Specification: Zen Notifications

## Overview
Implement system notifications for breakpoints and long-running tasks to keep developers informed even when they are away from their terminal.

## Requirements
- Integrate with system notification systems (macOS, Linux, Windows).
- Trigger a notification when a breakpoint is hit.
- Provide options to notify upon completion of execution if it takes longer than a configurable threshold.
- Ensure notifications are non-intrusive and follow the project's 'Zen' philosophy.
